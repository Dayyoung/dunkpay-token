# Dear friends,

This white paper is related to selling DunkPay tokens. DunkPay is a service that allows you to make payments using your Cryptocurrency. If the user makes a payment through DunkPay, we will charge a purchase fee. In addition, we are developing services that link with offline by applying DunkPay. We decided to sell DunkPay's service profits as tokens. DunkPay is a running service. No specific sales terms or constraints. Refunds are also available at any time.

# Send ETH for buying , Send DNK for refunds.

Buying or selling DunkPay tokens does not require cryptocurrency exchanges. You can get DNK when you deposit ETH to a smart contract address. Or you can refund when you deposit the DNK. All functions such as purchases, refunds, bankruptcies, etc. operate as smart contracts.

# DunkPay Token (ERC20 - DNK)
```
Total volume : 10,000,000 DNK
Sales volume : 4,900,000 DNK (49%)
Additional volume : PoS for token users.
```
# DunkPay Token PoS (Proof-of-Stake)

The rules are very simple. Take a snapshot on the first day of the month (GMT 00:00). You will receive a DunkPay token by PoS based on (holdings / total issue volume).  For PoS, you should have more than 1,000 DNK.
(However, if there is no fee income, it may carry forward.)
```
Ex., 
Nov 2018, Total fees of DunkPay commission - 1,200 ETH * 1000
On Dec 1, 2018, We will divide 1,200,000 DNK for each user (Holdings / Total Issue Volume) to PoS.

5,000 DNK holder = (5000/10000000) * 1200000 = Additional 600 DNK
```
# DunkPay Token Units 

Unit|Value|Jordan
 ------------- |-------------|:-----
 jordan (Jordan)     | 1 jordan | 1 
 Kjordan (Magic)     | 1e3 jordan | 1,000 
 Mjondan (Shaq)     | 1e6 jordan | 1,000,000 
 Gjordan (Kobe)     | 1e9 jordan | 1,000,000,000 
 microdunk (LeBron)     | 1e12 jordan | 1,000,000,000,000 
 millidunk (Stephan)    | 1e15 jordan | 1,000,000,000,000,000 
 dunk (DNK)     | 1e18 jordan | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 

Apply the same units as ETH. 1 DNK can also be expressed as 1e18 jordan. Regretfully, Kobe and LeBron are not Jordan's opponents.

# DunkPay Token Buying (Purchase)

When a customer deposits ETH into a smart contract address, the customer immediately receives the token with the same ETH address as the DunkPay token. Up to 50% bonus will apply depending on remaining sales volume.
```
1 ETH = (100% + 50% * (Sales Remaining Volume / Total Issue volume)) * 1000 DNK

Ex., In case of : 2,450,000 DNK of 10,000,000 DNK is remains.
1 ETH = (1 + (0.5 * 0.245)) * 1000 = 1,122 DNK
```
# DunkPay Token Selling (Refund)

Customers can sell DunkPay tokens by running the Refund to Smart Contract address. It is reverse buying calculation. Up to 50% penalty will apply depending on remaining sales volume.

```
1 DNK = (50% + 50% * (Sales Remaining Volume / Total Issue Volume)) / 1000 ETH

Ex., In case of : 2,450,000 DNK  of 10,000,000 DNK is remains.
1,125 DNK = (562 + (562 * 0.245)) / 1000 = 0.699 ETH
```
